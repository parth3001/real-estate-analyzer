  frontend: {
    framework: "React 18+ with TypeScript",
    stateManagement: "Redux Toolkit + RTK Query",
    styling: "Material-UI (MUI) v5 + Custom theme",
    charts: "Recharts + D3.js for advanced visualizations",
    buildTool: "Vite for fast development"
  },
  
  backend: {
    runtime: "Node.js 18+ with Express",
    database: "PostgreSQL for main data + Redis for caching",
    apiArchitecture: "RESTful APIs + GraphQL for complex queries",
    authentication: "JWT + OAuth 2.0",
    fileStorage: "AWS S3 for reports and documents"
  },
  
  infrastructure: {
    hosting: "AWS (ECS/Fargate for containers)",
    cdn: "CloudFlare for global performance",
    monitoring: "DataDog + Sentry for error tracking",
    ci_cd: "GitHub Actions for automated deployment"
  }
}
```

#### **Database Schema Design**
```sql
-- Core Multi-Family Property Analysis Schema
CREATE TABLE properties (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    property_address JSONB NOT NULL,
    property_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'multifamily',
    unit_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_sqft INTEGER,
    year_built INTEGER,
    purchase_price DECIMAL(12,2),
    
    -- Multi-family specific
    unit_mix JSONB, -- Array of unit types with details
    rent_roll JSONB, -- Current rents by unit
    operating_expenses JSONB,
    
    -- Analysis results
    financial_analysis JSONB,
    market_analysis JSONB,
    ai_insights JSONB,
    
    -- Metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    analysis_version VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE market_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    location JSONB NOT NULL, -- City, state, coordinates
    data_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'comparable', 'rental', 'demographic'
    data_source VARCHAR(50), -- API source
    data_payload JSONB,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE api_usage (

    api_endpoint VARCHAR(100),
    request_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    cost_cents INTEGER,
    date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

#### **API Integration Layer**
```javascript
// API Service Architecture
class MarketDataService {
  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
    this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
      tokensPerInterval
