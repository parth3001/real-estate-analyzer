# Frontend Update Plan for Unified Backend (2025-06-03)

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps needed to update the frontend to align with the new unified backend API, TypeScript-first workflow, sample endpoints, and automated smoke testing.

---

## 1. Update API Service Layer ✅
- Use the unified `/api/deals/analyze` endpoint for both SFR and MF analysis.
- Add calls to `/api/deals/sample-sfr` and `/api/deals/sample-mf` for demo/testing or form prefill.

## 2. Update Data Types and Interfaces ✅
- Ensure the frontend sends a payload with a `propertyType` field (`'SFR'` or `'MF'`) and the correct structure for each property type.
- Update frontend types to expect the unified response:
  - `monthlyAnalysis`
  - `annualAnalysis`
  - `longTermAnalysis`
  - `keyMetrics`
  - `aiInsights`
- Created adapter in `adapters.ts` to convert between backend `AnalysisResult<T>` and frontend `Analysis` types
- Updated API service to use the adapter for seamless type conversion
- Fixed type issues in components to work with consistent `Analysis` type

## 3. Update Forms and Submission Logic ✅
- Fixed error handling in MultiFamilyAnalysis to work with the unified API response
- Created sampleMultiFamilyData.ts with default MF data for testing
- Updated MultiFamilyAnalysis to use sample data when no saved deal is found
- Verified that both SFR and MF forms send propertyType field in their payloads
- Ensured both form components pass data to the analyzeDeal function correctly

## 4. Update Analysis Results Display ✅
- Enhanced MultiFamilyAnalysisResults component with comprehensive visualizations:
  - Added tabs for key metrics, projections, and AI analysis
  - Created charts for expense breakdown, cash flow, equity growth, and property value appreciation
  - Added yearly projections table and exit analysis section
  - Improved formatting for currency and percentage values
- Fixed TypeScript issues by adding proper type definitions and simplifying complex components
- Added multi-family specific metrics section
- Expanded AI insights section to display all available data from unified API

## 5. Update Error Handling ✅
- Updated error handling in API service to properly handle new error format
- Added proper type checking for API responses
- Used try/catch blocks with type-safe error handling in all API calls
- Added descriptive error messages that are user-friendly
- Ensured consistent error handling across both SFR and MF components

## 6. Update Saved Deals (if applicable) ✅
- Updated SavedDeal and Deal interfaces to use the unified Analysis type
- Enhanced DealService to handle both SFR and MF property types
- Added separate saveSFRDeal and saveMFDeal methods for type safety
- Added method to filter deals by property type
- Updated the data structure to ensure proper property type is stored
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing saved deals

## 7. Update/Write Frontend Tests
- Update or add tests to verify:
  - Correct payloads are sent for both SFR and MF.
  - The UI correctly renders the unified analysis response.
  - Error handling works with the new format.

## 8. (Optional) Add Smoke Test UI
- Optionally, add a simple UI or dev tool to call the sample endpoints and display the results for quick manual verification.

## Next Steps
1. Review and update your API service and types.
2. Update forms and results components.
3. Test end-to-end with both SFR and MF flows.
